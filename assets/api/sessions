Many of these processes are currently done manually, but why not automate them? Fabric’s set of developer tools, collectively called fastlane, makes building, testing, and releasing your app faster, reproducible and less troublesome, leaving developers more time to focus on feature code and not deployment! Learn how you can automate the tedious tasks to generate release notes, screenshots and push your final submission Google Play portal effortlessly from your command line with a powerful open source tool. github.com/fastlane/fastlane/",

This API makes use of an array of technologies like Wifi, Bluetooth, Beacons and even audio to communicate with nearby objects like bus stops, train platforms or even indoor locations like a museum. There are a lot of possibilities for using the Nearby API, for example creating a local Multiplayer game where people nearby can join a game without internet connection, or a smart bus stop that tells you when your bus is delayed and provides entertainment while you wait. The use cases are almost endless. This talk will touch the Nearby Messages API, the Nearby Locations API and the (eddystone) beacon technology.",

MVP gave us a long-awaited clean architecture in Android apps, while Dagger 2 brought it to a whole new level by removing all the boilerplate code that we don't like writing. In this talk, I will demonstrate the benefits of the MVP architecture and its reusability and scalability. I’ll go over Dagger’s role in MVP as well as unit testing, and show how to focus on creating reusable modules on a concrete example.",

Iterating quickly, we try to keep up a bi-weekly release cycle – along with a lot of refactorings to keep control of the code. After almost two years we are looking back at a journey of testing. With more than 700 distinctive instrumentation tests (including unit tests, screenshot tests, UI integration tests), a full test run would take about 40 minutes and we use a lot of tricks to keep the turnaround time low. The talk will outline several of the issues that we encountered (method count limits in library test APKs, Espresso test flakiness, slow execution speeds of instrumentation tests, etc.) and how we managed to overcome them.",

	"description": "For years crash handling was one of the worst parts of the Android development process. With each new crash you were risking a lot - getting bad Google Play reviews, negative comments and dissatisfied customers. Nobody likes the \"Unfortunately, your app has crashed\" dialog, but there was only so much you could do about it, beside logging the crash to a remote server. In the last couple of months a lot has changed. We've been introduced to brand new tools to help us cope with this problem. During this talk, we'll demonstrate how to use several tools and techniques that have made our lives easier. We'll discuss different ways of predicting crashes even before they occur by means of static code checkers, automatic tests and CI setup. Additionally, we'll show you how to detect memory leaks, explain advanced exception and crash logging by using a combination of several different tools. Finally, we’ll demonstrate how to provide a better crash experience or hide the crash altogether if the crash is simply inevitable!",

	"description": "The slogan ‘#PERFMATTERS’ by Colt McAnlis is one of the most important statements, which an Android developer should follow. A well performing application makes the difference between a nice looking application and one, which gets successful. You, as an Android developer, have the responsibility to delight your users, so they don’t feel how much work your application has to burden to fulfill the user’s needs. This session will show you some easy optimizations and how to avoid glitches in the application. A lot of developers would shout, that this is premature optimization. In contrary it is preventive. With a small amount of work while developing you can avoid a lot of pitfalls. You will hopefully have a better understanding of the underlying system afterwards. During the session some tools and frameworks will be presented for helping you to fulfill your mission.",

	"description": "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity amongst the Android developer community. It’s a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines. Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it’s much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. And this is especially noticeable comparing with the soon-to-be-archaic versions of Java used on Android. But what’s even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. It’s a pragmatic language with a very low learning curve, and can be quickly grasped by Java developers. In this talk we’ll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, as well as additional goodies designed specifically for Android.",

	"description": "We introduce Android Auto, yet another way to connect your smartphone to the car, and compare it with other solutions. By presenting the Android Auto APIs with current features and restrictions as well as the development workflow and toolset the audience will have the necessary input to start coding. When we first heard about Android Auto, we had visions of an awesome smartphone/car integration in mind. Unfortunately the current use cases for apps are limited to music and texting and we have no access to vehicle data (e.g. GPS position, speed, engine type). The development of Android Auto apps is straightforward for the given use cases and your music or texting app can be easily extended to the Android Auto context. Nevertheless we found some pitfalls that we would like to share. Android Auto is bleeding edge: APIs, development tools, etc. are changing fast, documentation is rare and toolkits are still unstable. Testing the app on real car head units is difficult. The fast update cycles of the Android Auto OS with new features during the last couple of months raise our hopes, that the APIs will be extended to more interesting uses cases very soon.",
